# OpenGL Data Visualization

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a project developed during the **Data Visualization** course in the fifth semester at **AGH University of Krakow**. The project focuses on creating an interactive 3D scene using **OpenGL** in **C++**, with the help of the **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) and **GLM** (OpenGL Mathematics) libraries. The scene features a **first-person camera** that allows the user to navigate and interact with multiple 3D objects.

The project demonstrates key concepts in computer graphics, including:
- 3D object rendering
- Texture mapping
- Lighting and shading
- Camera movement and interaction

---

## Features
- **First-Person Camera**: Move around the scene using the keyboard and mouse.
- **3D Object Rendering**: Render multiple 3D objects with textures and lighting.
- **Texture Mapping**: Apply textures to objects.

## Screenshots
Here are some screenshots of the project:

1. **Scene with Multiple Models**

## Technologies Used
- **OpenGL**: For rendering 3D graphics.
- **SFML**: For window management, input handling, and context creation.
- **GLM**: For mathematics operations like vectors, matrices, and transformations.
- **C++**: The primary programming language used for development.
